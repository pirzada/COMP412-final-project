# COMP412-final-project

We are working on the final project of the class. Our group's idea is to create a tool that helps students to find out clusters of courses available within certain hours.

Thus, students can create a schedule that help them to optimize their available time.

We are working on the Fall semester, 2015 courses schedule of Loyola University Chicago.
